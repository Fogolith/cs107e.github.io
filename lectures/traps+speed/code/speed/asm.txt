Store Multiple registers.

Syntax
 STM{addr_mode}{cond} Rn{!}, reglist{^}

where:
addr_mode
   Default: Increment address After each transfer.

cond
   is an optional condition code (see Conditional execution).

Rn ---- is the base register, the ARM register holding the initial
address for the transfer. Rn must not be r15.

!
 	is an optional suffix. If ! is present, the final address is written
	back into Rn.

reglist
	is a list of one or more registers to be loaded or stored,
	enclosed in braces. It can contain register ranges. It must be
	comma separated if it contains more than one register or register
	range (see Examples).  See Restrictions on reglist in 32‑bit
	Thumb‑2 instructions.
