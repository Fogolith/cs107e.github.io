0-main
	i think do this after 1-largest
	"why do we have to return when we don't care?"

1-largest.c
	C parses the largest token possible, left to right.

	so: a---b ===> a-- - b;   [post-decrement, -b discarded]

	a-----b; ====> parse error.  [a-- -- -b]
	
  single character change to make this compile?
	a--+--b;


2-sideefects.c
	are there any syntax errors here?

	C can have all sorts of side-effect free statements.

	you can cast something to void.   actually if you think about it, 
	this is interesting.  can't have a var of that type.

	"," is ok.  it's a comma seperated expression list.  you see those
	all the time in for loops.   but you can do them anywhere.


3-comma
	comma: right most value is the value of the expression

	can have expression statements as well: last statement is the 
	result.
		how can you use this?

		it was intended for macros that returned a value.

4-and
	& will often work.

	does not short circuit.

	does not guard end.

	case where it does not work?

		// this will fail if they don't share bits.
		if(x & y)


	it should always work if there is a logical expression, other than
	not short circuiting.

5-or
        what about |?

		"does || short circuit?"

6-or
	this shows why you need short circuit.

	if you didn't have short circuit what would have have to do?

		if(i > ...)
			if(array...)

	is the compiler allowed to reorder these?  there is no write..
		actually: what is the rule?  one way to look at it is that
		you will run the code with a much broader set of inputs.

		e.g., a bug we found in the flash controller.

			if(some condition)
				assert();

7 precedence
	if ',' bound more tightly?
		your for loop init & etc would behave very oddly.
