### Welcome to the Winter 2016 offering of CS107e!

CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence.
CS106 provides students with a solid foundation in programming methodology and
abstractions, and CS107 follows on to give you the skills needed to build
computer systems. The course will start with the microprocessor and move up to
the C programming language, without skipping anything in between. The goal is
to build a solid understanding of all aspects of how modern computers execute
programs and how program development tools work.
