/**
 * @fn void dmb(void)
 *
 * Executes a data memory barrier operation using the c7 (Cache Operations)
 * register of system control coprocessor CP15.
 *
 * All explicit memory accesses occurring in program order before this operation
 * will be globally observed before any memory accesses occurring in program
 * order after this operation.  This includes both read and write accesses.
 *
 * This differs from a "data synchronization barrier" in that a data
 * synchronization barrier will ensure that all previous explicit memory
 * accesses occurring in program order have fully completed before continuing
 * and that no subsequent instructions will be executed until that point, even
 * if they do not access memory.  This is unnecessary for what we need this for.
 *
 * On the BCM2835 (Raspberry Pi), this is needed before and after accessing
 * peripherals, as documented on page 7 of the "BCM2835 ARM Peripherals"
 * document.  As documented, it is only needed when switching between
 * _different_ peripherals.
